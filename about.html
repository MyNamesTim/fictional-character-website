    <h3>Eric Cartman, one of the main characters in South Park, is a bold, larger-than-life figure known for his outrageous antics and larger-than-life personality. With his iconic red jacket, blue hat, and round frame, Cartman is instantly recognizable. He’s a master manipulator, often devising elaborate schemes to get what he wants, whether it’s winning a school competition, starting a boy band, or even opening his own amusement park. Cartman’s confidence borders on arrogance, and he frequently demands respect with his catchphrase, "Respect my authority!" Despite his often selfish and bratty behavior, he has a unique charm that makes him both hilarious and unforgettable. His dynamic with his friends—Stan, Kyle, and Kenny—ranges from camaraderie to rivalry, as his over-the-top personality often clashes with their more grounded perspectives. Cartman’s antics and larger-than-life persona make him a standout character, embodying the show’s blend of absurdity and humor.</h3>
